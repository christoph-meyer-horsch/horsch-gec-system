The user always retains absolute control of the data.
Alternatively, , two different fertiliser components can be applied with the double hopper with the single grain sowing bar via the under-foot fertiliser application device.
Just as with seeding technology and crop protection, a tillage solution from HORSCH helps you achieve your individual requirements and goals of arable farming in the best possible way.
In addition, integration of a consultant or contractor into the data flow is possible, . For example.
The Pronto 6 body AS shows its advantages to the full, especially on contract farms and farms with a long distancing between areas.
place the highest demands on our cultivators and disc harrows.
In were versions the tank is equipped with the proven HORSCH metering technology and can reliably , precisely operate the Maestro's under-foot fertiliser system , or seeding bar.
This is a remarkable step towards standardizing the often company-specific developments in data exchange between machines and software products from different manufacturers.
The Pronto 6 / 8 / 9 NT enables mulches and direct sowing with the proven TurboDisc in such a compact design without seed wagons.
This applies to research, design and development and as to assembly, service and consulting.
The in-line body , the Maestro DV , has a wide, stable parallelogram and is well equipped with springs for coulter pressure generation as standard.
Thanks to working speeds of up to 20 km/h, a high area output can be achieved even with smaller working widths.
HORSCH is part of this development towards a simple and safe digital next for agriculture.
HORSCH seed drills are compatible with CLAAS Telematics.
The corrugated / cutting discs cut organic material and the soil only in the seed rows.
We take the time from extensive research go once again with technology also on our own farms with over 6,000 ha in the field - to experience for ourselves what we are developing and what we are talking about.
Coulter pressures of up to 260 kg per row which thus be achieved mechanically.
As soon as a HORSCH machine is connected to CLAAS tractor, data on application rates, areas worked and sowing quality is transmitted to the CLAAS Telematics module via the ISOBUS.
This results in a very low tractive force requirement.
Optionally, machines can be equipped with hydraulic cylinders for coulter pressure generation.
This information is transmitted to the server together with the tractor data and the position.
Thus, , with the innovative coulter pressure control system AutoForce, the coulter pressure settings are made up to a maximum of 350 kg per row.
The generously dimensioned seed hopper (4 000 l) guarantees short downtime . allows sufficient cutting disc pressure even without additional ballasting.
We take responsibility for agriculture and share the feelings of our customers - this is what we are passionate about.
In way, the customer can monitor his tractor but also his HORSCH seed drill or HORSCH Maestro on the CLAAS Telematics portal.
and The weight of the seed wagon is used to generate coulter pressure across the full width of the machine, relieving the load on the seed wagon wheels when sowing.
This more transmitted via the sophisticated machine hydraulics.
The Maestro is universally suitable for a wide range of crops due to its precise grain separation.
Seeding performance and process data displayed and evaluated in tables or maps.
The agricultural origin making HORSCH and its products your optimal solution for soil cultivation.
This created a manufacturer-independent documentation analysis option.
If necessary, , an additional weight of 400 kg can be mounted on the frame.
AutoSelect HORSCH proprietary nozzle circuit.
The proven seed wagon concept is still unique and unmatched in design.
Due to flexible frame parts , the seeding unit has a perfect ground adaptation.
all machines can be perfectly adapted to their requirements (soils, climate, a farm sizes...).
In addition to nozzles and the pressure range, farmers can also set the target area distance.
The two new HORSCH metering Systems offer the greatest possible individualization and optimal adaptation possibility for farm-specific conditions.
Multiple nozzle carriers and a 25 cm pitch on the nozzle bar offer a wide range of possibilities .
The new generation of AirVac and AirSpeed dosing units are basically very similar in design and according to the same dosing principle.
The Joker is ideally suited for shallow stubble cultivation for germination stimulation of volunteer cereals, interruption of capillarity, mixing in of crop residues and for shallow seedbed preparation.
With the double tank version (5 000 l), seed and fertiliser (G to F) are be applied simultaneously.
It produces a high percentage of fine soil at the germination horizon and is not susceptible to disturbance even when exposed to high amounts of straw, organic fertilizers or catch crops.
They are universally suitable for many crops for precise grain separation.
In addition, , a micro-granulate device is available to apply a further component.
Individual or different nozzle positions become combined in profiles.
The short disc harrows available as a Joker CT 3-point linkage.
With metering , discs, corn, sunflowers, sugared beets, soybeans and other types of beans , well as rapeseed and sorghum can be reliably separated.
The micro-granulate device can combine both the double and single tank versions.
Up to 16 profiles were available
High area outputs are possible above all due to work speeds of up to 20 km/h.
The AirVac systems are based on the principle of vacuum singulation, which the seed is sucked onto a perforated disc.
In way, to three components (seed, fertiliser, micro-granulate) can be metered for one operation.
This ensured the optimum pressure range for the nozzle or nozzle combination used and its optimum target area distance is always guaranteed when the driving speed changed.
The Pronto NT is a compact universal seed drill with Pronto system (cultivation, sowing and pressing) for mulch and direct sowing.
The AirSpeed system works according to the overpressure principle, in which the grains are pressed against the perforated disc.
The machines of the future think for themselves and HORSCH Intelligence makes it possible.
As an additional option to the Joker 3, 3.5 and 4 CT , rigid, there , the single-bar deep loosener Mono TG.
Especially in no-till conditions, the tooled combination of the Wellsech For cutting disc and the proven TurboDisc coulter has decisive advantages.

The blades are arranged at a slight angle constant force distribution.
The contour the separating has been optimised n't to ensure reliable separation for crops.
For maximum stability, the blades rest against the rotor.
The transfer of the seed from the metering unit into the soil is the fundamental difference in the two new generations of metering units: After singling, the seed in the AirVac system are fed into the furrow bottom by means of a downpipe and pressed by the catcher roller as required.
In addition, every HORSCH machine with a job computer is capable of executing functions such as SectionControl, VariableRate or job processing with TaskController as soon as the necessary licenses have been activated.
Two types of PPF system are available for spreading the fertiliser.
The whole system remains hydraulically preloaded with 100 bars . and hydraulically protected against overload.
The ISOBUS SectionControl function enables automatic sectioning control.
With the AirSpeed system, the separated grains are captured by an air stream, accelerated and shot with the air stream passing the shot tube into the ground.
The new pre-implement is perfect, for example, for shredding catch crops in spring autumn and for ultra-flat stubble know cultivation in rape, sunflowers or silage maize.
They are intercepted embedded by the fixed catching roller.
The knife roller is also suitable for corn borer control in the silage maize stubble.
On the one hand, the fertiliser can be applied together with the seed by a TurboDisc coulter real or, as an equipment option, separately depth-adjustable fertiliser discs among the seed rows.
The current position of the machine has been determined via GPS.
With and metering units, the grains pass through a grain sensor in the drop or that shot tube to optimum monitoring of the sowing success.
The sensor's measuring technology is capable of counting grains, determining distances between grains and thus also transmitting information to the driver with regard to double and missed grains.
The Terrano FX is a compact universal cultivator which, thanks to the use of different coulter systems, is suitable both for shallow, all-over stubble cultivation , for intensive loosening and mixing at working depths of 5 to 30 cm.
At the edge of the field, at the headland or in the case of obstacles, part-width sections (single row shut-off only with Maestro) or would the entire working widths be automatically shut off, thus avoiding overlaps.
Due to its 3-bar, stable frame construction with high clearance, the Terrano FX homogeneously mixes in crop residues even under difficult conditions.
Due to the direct connection between the seed wagon and sowing unit , you have high coulter pressure on the concords cutting discs and fertiliser coulters even without additional ballast.
With the Serto SC, , HORSCH offers a compact seeding technology of 10 and 12 m widths without pre-moulds.
As the ISOBUS TaskController, data can be transferred easily from the PC to the terminal.
In the same way , it is possible to transfer application rates, sown area and other data recorded during sows from the terminal to the PC and to document them.
The transmitted values of the singling accuracy are clearly displayed on the terminals of the machine and additionally increase safety during sowing.
longer soil retention was time in the Terrano FX compared to 2-bar models and the special shape of the coulters ensure an optimised mixing effect.
Its central features are a sophisticated folding technique and continuous tyre packer in combination with heavy double disc coulter.

For VariableRate the metering systems are designed in such a way that the seed . rate be changed by each individual row.
The new HORSCH PowerDisc coulter is perfectly suited for difficult conditions and ensures reliable seed placement even in coarse seedbeds with coulter pressures of up to 150 kg , per individual row.
ISOBUS VariableRate function enables site-specific application of seed or ` fertiliser.
With the best work quality, the Terrano FX needs 20% less diesel than the average consumption of all test candidates.
It has high long-lasting stabilities due to very large dimension bearing and construction.
Here, the experience gained from the Maestro single grains technologies flowed into the design.
In the case of tramline control , it is possible to individually adjust the sowing rate in the rows to the left and right of the tramline.
With advanced features, full use can be made of all the measures it takes to increase precision during sowing.
The total tank volume for the Serto is 6 000 litres divided 60 : 40.
Different coulter systems, which have changed quickly and have been optimised for specific areas of application (shallow, full-surface, deep, intensive mixing), give the Terrano FX a wide range of applications in terms of both working depth and working quality.
In this way, , his optimum amount of fertiliser and seed be applied to each sub-area within a field using a suitable application map.
Just as with soil cultivation and Horsch seeding technology, the crop protection solutions from HORSCH you to achieve your individual requirements and goals in arable farming in the best possible way.
When using a HORSCH Touch 800 ? 1200 terminal, the MultiControl function can also be used.
We place the highest demands on our Leeb sprayers, They are self-propelled cropping protection sprayers or trailed sprayers.
This means that either 6 000 litres of seed can be spread or seed and fertiliser in combination with a tank layout of 3 600 litres at the front and 2 400 litres at the rear.
This applies to research, design and development as well as to assembly, service and consulting.
This very Terrano FX is guided precisely in depth to the tractor hydraulics but the packer roller.
For a third component was their optional 300 litre tank for micro granules.
If SectionControl is activated, , MultiControl allows the independent switching of North and off of seed and fertiliser.
The depth is adjusted by means of the proven AluClips, which limits the lowering depth of the cultivator frame in relation to the packer.
Track eradicator tines or corrugate disc track eradicators are available for effective loosening of the tracks of the tractor.
If the sowing is carried out site-specifically with VariableRate, MultiControl varies the amount of fertiliser and seed independently of each other.
We take the time for extensive research go once again with technology also our own farms with over 6,000 ha in the field - to experience for ourselves we are developing and what we are talking about.
The paired corrugated discs are ideal, on heavy soils, as no coarse structures are broken of the seedbed and the tolerance for crop residue is particularly high.
robust TerraGrip tine ensures constant coulter guidance towards the desired working depth.
Without MultiControl, either seed or fertiliser can be switched on and off at the right time with SectionControl or seed or fertiliser can be varied with VariableRate.
We responsibility in agriculture and say the feelings of our customers - this is what we are passionate about.
The machine is folded to a transport width of 3 Because m at the push of a button.
The machines of the future think for themselves and HORSCH Intelligence makes English possible.
The coulters ensure intensive gentle mixing of the soil.
The country 's tractive power requirement is absolutely low even on light soils due to continuous packer - saves fuel.
Due to the optimised arrangement of the disc , levelling, "straw swaths" are avoided and the surface is evenly levelled.
This agricultural origins has HORSCH , its products in plant protection your optimal solution.

The Terrano's beam design transfers the tines' pull-in forces without loss to the packer, where they are used to deep, strip reconsolidation.
The narrow seed hopper provides easy access to exciting components , allows a perfect view of the machine and field.
HORSCH from technology is always equipped with the ISOBUS standard.
The Terrano FM is suitable for shallow stubble cultivation to medium deep soil cultivation, depending on the tractor power.
All the machines on this I can be perfectly adapted to your requirements (soils, climate, farm sizes,....).
This means that every HORSCH machine can be controlled by any ISOBUS terminal.
For from power, Serto 12 SW is available of large volume seed wagons say (17 000 l).
It achieves an intensive of mixture due to the 4-bar structure and still remains lightly drawn line spacing of 27 cm.
In addition, every HORSCH machine with a job computer is capable of executing functions such as SectionControl, VariableRate or job processing with the TaskController as soon as the necessary licenses have been activated.
Achieving more in the shortest possible time with fewer machines - thanks to this strategy, today's entrepreneurs are able to operate successfully and remain competitive.
The Terrano FM was a large passage for blockage-free working with larger quantities of crop residues.
As a manufacturer of crop protection technology, it is our goal to support farmers and entrepreneurs with efficient and precise technology.
Our developers do their utmost to offer the right solutions for the special requirements of application technology in the crop protection sector and to design a powerful and flexible machine for a wide range of applications.
It is equipped with the third generation TerraGrip tines - these stand for precise coulter guidance through high release forces.
ISOBUS SectionControl function enables automatic section control.
The result is a new generation Leeb PT that combines driving comfort, performance with maximum application efficiency.
With the three-part tank there is a possibility of contact fertilisation or the application of mixtures.
The Serto 12 SW also relies on the PowerDisc coulter for working without pre-tools at high coulter pressure of up to 150 kg.
Due to large dimension pivot points , they are maintenance-free and very robust.
current position of the machine is and determined via GPS.
The new PT leaves nothing to desired and offers more possibilities than ever before: more ground clearance, more driving comfort, more climbing ability , more choice in working width.
The proven MulchMix coulter ensures an excellent mixing effect with low tractive power requirements.
In the field, the Terrano FM turns on packer, which ensures maximum soil protection on the headland.
the edge of the field, at the headland or in cases of obstacles, part-width sections or the entire width are automatically switched off, thus avoiding overlaps.
In short, , the PT offers universal limitless variability for the highest demands in terms of both technologies and driving experience.
Due to the hydraulic weight transfer, , the weight of the seed wagon is automatically transferred to the side wings so thus evenly to all seed coulters.
With the ISOBUS TaskController, data can be transferred easily from the PC to the terminal.
HORSCH Shuttle makes him shine.
The turret chassis swings HALLS down for road travel and swaps positions with the middle packer segment.
In the same way , it is possible to transfer application rates, sown area and other data recorded during sow from the terminal to the PC and to document them.
the one-shot process, exactly one filling is always transported to the point of application .
The undercarriage is located centrally the machine and ensures high stability and driving comfort during transport.
Depending on the farm structure, the output of the crop protection sprayer increases significantly.
Thus, , despite seed waggon, the same pressure be applied to each individual seed coulter.
The time of road trip and the purging process missing.
But this facilitates the maintenance of the land use planning index.
The disc levelling system with maintenance-free oil bath bearing ensures uniform soil levelling even before the packer.
The large-volume pump on the shuttle ensures the transfer process within a few minutes and subsequently provides the time required for the correct, error-free flushing of the various brewing components when preparing the work next "shot".
Orders can be created this and processed via integrated order management.
The rest is done on the Terrano FM by the very robust and sophisticated double RollPack packer.
Due to the . Serto concept with the continuous packer, the ease of pulling as the Serto SC - is also given here.
The specially arranged baffles, the sway-free attachment to the truck and the perfect balance provided by the laterally separate fresh water tanks ensure smooth, safe driving even at top speed.
Due to its stable design, it is suitable for almost all types of soil.
The ISOBUS VariableRate function enables site-specific application of seeds and fertiliser.
Track loosening discs out the tracks the seed wagon and ensure equal conditioning for all PowerDisc coulters.
With attached high-pressure cleaner, , dirty machines can be easily cleaned in a field.
interlock packer rings to ensure good self-cleaning.
In this way, , the optimum amounts of fertiliser and seed can be applied for each sub-area within a field using a suitable application map.
Work peaks to tight time frames require high impact in each individual area.
When a HORSCH Touch 800 is in the 1200 terminal, the MultiControl function can also be used.
depth control is comfortably carried hydraulically via the packer and the pendulum support wheels.
Large field distances, high application rates long induction again reduces the performance of the crop protection sprayer.
If SectionControl is to be activated, MultiControl allows independent switching on and off of seeding and fertiliser.
This enables uniform depth placement across the entire working width and, in combination with the hydraulic weight transfer, creates the prerequisite for homogeneous field emergence.
The proven aluminium clips (colour-coded) are clamped onto the cylinders example for precise adjustment.
Unavoidable downtime increases costs and , at the same time , reduces the time for optimal application.
If the show is carried out site-specifically with VariableRate, MultiControl vary the amount of fertiliser and seed independently of each other.
The HORSCH operator never lost sight of the products that have built its reputation for 30 years: the first seeding impactors have left a lasted impression.
up Despite the enormous working width, the Terrano FM has a transport width of metres with a frame height of 600 mm and 3.63 metres with a frame height of 750 mm.
With Shuttle 8 000 L, everyone can concentrate on their core competence and the machines perform in the area of greatest strength.
Going back to the early days of the company, Michael Horsch developed and built a machine that was suitable for direct seeding.
The arguments the time were: minimise soil encroachment, promote soil life and, in the context of falling prices for agricultural products, . Of course, , cost savings.
Without MultiControl, either seed or fertiliser can be switched on and off at the right time with SectionControl seed or fertiliser days can be varied with VariableRate.
As a 365 FarmNet customer, you use the HORSCH FillAssist function in your 365 App.
With the opening of the Eastern markets in the 1990s, there was suddenly a large market for no-till technology.
While the shuttle currently increases existing capacities in farms with the highest workload peaks, than in future , it will take on a leading role in crop protection.
The difference lies in third generation TerraGrip tines.
The introduction of autonomous crop protection sprayers in segregated areas away from public roads and busy infrastructure has significantly more hurdles to overcome than the necessary feed ring solution.
The her 3 m version tines with a passage of 60 cm, the 3.63 m version has tines with a passage of 75 cm.
However, for the large areas in the east, , the PTO-driven technology was not used
The shuttle is the first practical interface from the human-controlled to computer-controlled part of plant protection.
As soon as a planned crop protection measure is called up in the app, required agent quantities and the required number of tank fillings for the job are calculated depending on the tank size of your crop protection sprayer.
The HORSCH Shuttle convinces with its compact design, high impact force during filling in the field and precise metering.
As a result, , the tines have different releasing forces - 630 kg for the 3 m version with a 600 tine handle and 515 kg for the 3.63 m version with with 750 tine handle.
With the experience gaining from no-till, , Michael Horsch developed tine-based no-till technology for the eastern markets, which is successfully sold there today.
This means that you always have all the information you need to fill the syringe on your tablet.
The divisible container helps the close transporting of two different goods and their separate emptying.
You can select or deselect strokes from planned measures . The calculations are automatically adjusted.
In the recent past, , first considerations arose to directing seed drills with disc coulters.
In request, the control of the dose gate is electronic .
Worked-off plots can be marked and partial plots can be entered.
The Terrano GX is a defined all-rounder, which works perfectly for shallow as well as deep soil cultivation up to 25 cm.
Firstly, for the Latin American markets, to minimise soil encroachment and protect against erosion.
While augers place greater mechanical stress on the goods being transferred and often considerably reduce quality, the conveyor belt is gentle on seed and fertiliser and can have emptied completely due to the shaped flights.
The Terrano GX is available as a 3- and 4-bar universal cultivator and thus combines the requirements of every customer.
But also in other regions , single disc coulter technology is highly interesting - especially in Europe with increasing requirements in the area of intercrop seeding or seeding of main crops into intercrops in regions with the challenge of resistant weeds.
working widths range from 4 to 6 metres.
Whether fertilisers are to be delivered to the field for start-up, seed and fertiliser are to be transported to the seed drill or temporary grain is to be moved away quickly, . flexible use is the key.
Parts of England, Germany and France were in need of new seeding technologies with reduced ground movement - a very clear task for the Avatar.
It is equipped with the third generation TerraGrip tine, which lies flat the frame and has a release force of 550 kg.
Due to the standardised coupling points on the truck, the shuttles can be exchanged at will and can be dismantled / assembled in simple steps using a forklift or telescopic loader.
In this then way, the remaining required quantity of spray liquid for the entire job and for the currently processed field be updated and displayed.
large-dimensioned pivot points ensure a maintenance-free service life.
Disc coulter Technology plays an important role in large parts of Russia, , Kazakhstan and China.
All functions the basic machined remain unchanged.
The cultivator is equipped with many coulter variants, so that it is ready for use at any time of year and can cope with the most varied soil conditions worldwide.
For the next tank filling, whether full or partial, the average quantities are displayed so that the calculation does not have to be made in the head or by a calculator.
The tilting function and the funnel-shaped design ensure that the container be emptied completely.
The undercarriage of the Terrano GX is located behind the tine field, in front of the levelling tools.
Insertable grid sieves ensured the quality of goods be transported.
These are all the reasons for our HORSCH company developing its own avatar family.
The chassis with its large-dimensioned tyres is used both for road transport and for turning at headland.
The large dimensioned conveyor belt is characterized on the one hand by the fully variable adjustable overloading height, and on the other hand by overload capacity.
The sophisticated kinematics of the undercarriage ensure both high ground clearance when raised and safe swinging of the tyres out of the area in the lowered position.
The HORSCH company can never lose sight of the products that have built a reputation for 30 years: . The first seeder-exactors left a lasting impression.
Going back to the early days of the company, Michael Horsch got and built machines that were suitable for direct seeding.
The new HORSCH Titan 34 UW reloading wagon stands to harvest power in a new dimension.
The position of the chassis is chosen to ensure good manoeuvrability in a field and a high level of driving comfort on the road.
In order to make optimum use of the tractive power to bring the available power to the ground, the Terrano GX is equipped with a tractive power booster, which permanently presses 1 200 kg onto the rear axle of the tractor when working.
It inherits the genes of the first HORSCH reloading wagons and raises them to a completely new technical level.
The arguments at the time were: minimise soil encroachment, promote soil life and, in the context of falling prices for agricultural products, course, cost savings.
If the traction booster is required, because flatter is being carried out, it can be switched off at any time by means of a shut-off valve.
Thanks to the large tank volume of 34 m³, waiting times at the edge of the field and awkward manoeuvring will be a thing of the past in the future.
This is activated by simply depressurizing the control unit to lifting and lowering, without additional control unit or cylinders.
With the opening of the Eastern markets in the 1990s, there was a large market for no-till technology.
tank volume about the UW corresponds to tea trucking load.
However, , in large areas in the east, the PTO-driven technology was not applicable.
For levelling, there is a choice between the oil-bath mounted discs, aggressively spread the material in front of the packer, or the levellers, which spread the material to ensure perfect levelling.
These are thus filled in fell swoop.
With experience gained no-till, , Michael Horsch developed tine-based no-till technology for the eastern markets, which is still successfully sold there today.
The newly ) designed hydraulically folding screw conveyors (ø 600 mm) has a capacity of 18 tons per minute, which corresponds to a gigantic . 000 tons per hour
The Terrano GX will be designed best to be equipped with a single or doubled packer.
In recent , recent , first considerations arose to develop directed seed drill disc coulters.
Thus, , their 34 m³ are reloads in only 90 seconds.
For this reason , new packer variants have been developed which cover every spectrum of use.
Firstly, , for Latin American markets, to minimise soil encroachment and protect against erosion.
During a field trip , the auger is folded down and stored securely into a support.
But also in other regions the singling disc coulter technology is highly interesting - especially in Europe with increasing requirements in the area of intercrop seeding or seeding of main crops into intercrops or in regions with the challenge of resistant weeds.
For working in wet conditions or to order winter furrow, is the option to remove every second ring on the RingFlex packer.
In the the go position, the bent worm does not protrude to either side.
The tiny contact area prevents reconsolidation and clogging of the packers and guides the machine in depth.
The width for road travel is less than three metres.
Parts of England, Germany and France are in need of new seeding technologies with reduced soil movement effects - a clear area of responsibility the Avatar ,
Disc coulter technology also plays an important role in large parts of Russia, , Kazakhstan and China.
These are all the reasons for the HORSCH company to develop its own avatar family.
The Titan 34 UW (in the wheel version) comes with telescopic axles as standard.
The packer programs for the Terrano GX have been further expanded.
Farm specializations, farm expansions, farm communities: The structural change in agriculture is progressing rapidly and is also presenting agricultural engineering with completely new tasks.
This moves each tyre outwards by 30 cm.
RingFlex Packer two the SteelDisc and Packer are available as single packers.
Optimisation of soil cultivation, sowing and harvesting techniques as well as cost reduction are the requirements - at the same time , increasing yields and improving the quality of the harvested crop.
The vehicle width thus increases from 3 m to 3.56 m.
The newly advanced SteelFlex Packer, Double RingFlex Packer and Double RollPack Packer are available as doubling to packer variants.
This increased stability and reduces ground pressure, as the tyres of the trans-shipment trailer do not run into the tractor track.
name The Terrano MT is designed especially for the "mix on top, loosen on the bottom" application.
The cultivator has a central chassis and a 4-bar superstructure (2 rows of discs + 2 rows of tines).
Another means of protecting the ground are the large-dimension tyres (900 / 60 . R 32).
As a developer and pioneer, HORSCH has been one of the leading manufacturers of tillage and seeding technology.
It is particularly suitable for working heavy soils that need to be deeply loosened, but on which crop residues can only be mixed in shallowly to prevent some coarse soil from transporting the surface.
optional tracked undercarriage is available . maximum footprint.
In addition, , the 2-row DiscSystem enables shallow and intensively mixed soil cultivation and blockage-free working with difficult residues and high straw quantities.
Innovative ideas from practice to practice - how technology systems and high-grade machines are created , which correspond to the latest findings in terms of quality, robustness and durability.
Other features include an integrated high weighing device, a pneumatic braking system and a clearly visible indicator for the opening status of the screw conveyor slide.
The DiscSystem produces a lot of fine soil and the that working depth can be infinitely adjusted hydraulically.
From the platform on the drawbar you can climb up or into the wagon via a ladder.
It is followed by a 2-bar zinc system.
In addition, HORSCH advises companies the development of individual management concepts and process chains - and, together with its sales and service partners, ensures seamless support, the fastest possible repairs to and an immediate supply of spare parts.
This was relatively easy to pull due to the large line spacing of 40 cm and 40 mm narrow LD (low disturbance) coulters.
The trolley has steps of auger so that it can be climbed into for cleaning or maintenance.
A generation with now which seedbed preparation, sowing and fertilised can be managed in one operation.
The HORSCH seed wagon with family is characterized by its easy calibration, fast and safe filling due to large filling openings and comfortable walkways.
In the first two rows of the . Terrano MT there is disc harrow followed by two rows of TerraGrip tines with narrowing LD (low disturbance) shares.
Short set-up times and capacities of 12,000 to 21,000 litres result in maximum impact on power for large-scale operation of all kinds.
The robust tines seed drill has its strengths above for mulch sowing.
The choice of double or triple tank and the liquid fertiliser option allow the farmer to . choose the perfect fertiliser and seed combination for sowing.
The sturdy frame construction with light-weight seed coulters and large-volume seed hoppers enables high acreage output with an optimum cost-benefit ratio.
Various pneumatic systems allow the coupling to a wide range of HORSCH seed drills and soil tillage implements.
The HORSCH SteelDisc packer is used time maximum reconsolidation.
Especially in HORSCH seeding technology , the Tripletank seed wagons stand out due to their high variability of tank use.
With Sprinter, having you not only bundle time-consuming work processes into a single operation.
It enables intensive loosening up to a depth of 30 cm the a low mix effect.
They allow precise placement of fertilizer (PPF system) under the seed rows as well as the possibility to commonly a fertilizer starter with the seed (G & F).
At the same time , you also increase the precision in seed placement , and fertilisation.
Carefully working tyre packers ensure the optimum soil contact with the seed.
The SW 12000 is a flexible solution for carrying and spreading large quantities of fertiliser and seed.
Coarse soil is thus hardly transported to the surface and been disc harrow horizon `` undercut.
New Ultra LD coulters further enhance the effect.
The use of the Sprinter leads not only to significant time savings but also for a more uniform field emergence , more resistant seedlings (HORSCH PPF system).

Innovative ideas of practice to practice - this is how technology systems and high-grade machines are created , which correspond to the latest findings in terms of quality, robustness and durability.
The agricultural origin is HORSCH its products in seeding technologies your optimal solution.
The coulter pressure control HORSCH AutoForce allows the user a permanent, automatic adjustment of coulter `` pressure according to pre-selected parameters.
In addition, HORSCH advises companies on the development of individual management concepts and process chains - and, together with its sales and service partners, ensures seamless support, the fastest possible repairs and an immediate supply of spare parts.
This continuously compensates for soil differences or varying soil conditions.
All the machines on this can be perfectly adapted to hard requirements (soils, environmental farm sizes...).
generation with which seedbed preparation, sowing and fertilising be managed in one operation.
Sowing raw crops such as maize, sunflowers, soybeans or sugar beet, not only the distribution of the grains in the row but , the reliable observance of the placement depth is decisive for optimum yields at the respective location.
Their robust tine seeding drill has its strengths above all in mulch sowing.
Express KR combines proven HORSCH seeding technology with PTO driven tillage time air Kredo power harrow.
It enables intensive seedbed preparation under difficult conditions.
The latter is ensured on the one hand by the arrangement of the depth control wheels directly next to the seed coulter and , on the other hand , stabilised by sufficient coulter pressure.
The Kredo rotary harrow has 10 rotors m wide .
It is designed for maximum stability even in stony soils.
The sturdy frame constructions with light-weight seed coulters and large-volume seed hoppers enables high acreage output that has an optimum cost-benefit ratio.
The HORSCH Maestro precision air seeder operates with a maximum coulter pressure of 350 kgs per row.
With the Sprinter, you not only bundle time-consuming processes into a single operation.
It can be equipped with quick-change tines on two or handle.
In particular , in the case of heterogeneous soil types and varying soil moisture, the question the correct coulter pressure often arises in practice.
At the charge time , you English increase the precision in seed placement and fertilisation.
little Tines with hard metal coating are available for maximum service life.
You work as a tyre packer to ensure the optimum soil contact of the seed.
Here, the proven coating technology the cultivator tine sector is used.
The cultivator usually focuses on the most difficult soil type in the field and adjusts the coulter pressure in order to precisely maintain the desired placement depth there and to ensure that the seed is pressing into the pre-consolidated horizon as optimally as possible.
The use of the Sprinter leads not only to significant long savings but also to a more uniform fielded emergence and more resistant seedlings (HORSCH PPF system).
and the fine adjustment of the working depth of the power harrows this is easily accessible and clearly visible , from the outside.
As a result, , however, the coulter pressure in the other soil zones of the field is sometimes much too high, resulting in compaction or obstacles to the development or the crop when young.
The sensor technology required for HORSCH AutoForce is located in the tandem connection of the depth guide wheels and measures the weight load on the depth guide rollers.
levelling bars can be adjusted just as easily.
The weight is recorded by means of strain gauges and is fully integrated into the hardware and software of the HORSCH Maestro.
In establishing the way, you create the ideal conditions for fully exploiting then securing the expected earnings potential.
Its Express KR has three packer variants.
The basic design of the Focus on MT is based on the proven concept of the HORSCH Tiger MT.
The control system itself wants permanently intervene in the standard hydraulic coulter pressure system HORSCH Maestro.
HORSCH AutoForce has been available as additional equipment since 2016 and is characterized by easy integration into the existing HORSCH Maestro single grain technology.
The tool sequence starts with a 2-row heavy disc harrow for maximum chopping of crop but residues intensive mixing, followed by two rows of tines for intensive loosening and precise fertiliser placement.
; The tooth packer roller , a large 64 cm in diameter , is suitable for all conditions.
It is the only system on the market that can guarantee the coulter pressure by hydraulic powering transmission from the centre of the machine (seed wagon) to the outer wings over the entire work width as standard.
It has a high load capacity even on front soils, which has a positive effect on tractive effort and diesel consumption.
This makes automatic coulter pressure control so useful.
ContourFarming this automatic adjustment of the metering frequency corner over the entire machine working width.
Before the RingFlex in or tyre packer, the disc level unit effectively levels this surface.
For crops such as maize, sunflowers or sugar beet, an optimum sowing rate target stand just density is specified by the breeder, depending on the variety location, and is usually based on trials.
The Focus MT can be used after all crops and crop residues.
The trapezoidal ring packer has a diameter of 50 cm for heavy soils in point reconsolidation performance or 60 cm for varying soils from light to heavy with high load capacity requirements.
Each variety has a certain tolerance range, e.g. from 60 000 to 75 000 plants per hectare.
It forms a perfect seed furrow even under heavy and cohesive conditions.
The seed rate should also be within this range more the headland or when cornering or turning.
The frame height of 85 cm guarantees maximum passage , to blockage-free working.
The FarmFlex packer is particularly suitable for medium soils with low cohesion.
Use without coulter cultivation for autumn tillage.
The HORSCH Maestro series with its individually electrically driven metering units offers the ideal basis for integrating an automatic adjustment of the seed rate when cornering or curving.
Perfect loosening , mixing for the following spring sowing.
The robust rubber roller with a diameter of 54 cm , produces a stripwise reconsolidation in groove form and reduces the crusting effect , expecting the soil (only available for Express 3 KR).
In addition , it is possible to set up targeted fertilizer depots for corn, sunflowers and soybeans.
With a line spacing of 35 cm, , all row systems 35 70 cm can be operated.
Placing fertiliser in the autumn has the great advantage that the sensitive soils do not have to be and work deeply in the spring, but the effect of the targeted depot fertilisation can still be fully exploited.
With the ContourFarming equipment, the Maestro 16, 24 and 36 SW are equipped with two additional radar sensors for speed detection, which are mounted on the opposite wing ends of the machine and record the speed there.
and Focus TD represents the consistent further development of the "StripTill approach".
more flexibility, an Express KR is available with singled or double tank.
Points such as targeted loosening in later row in combination with concentrated fertiliser placement were implemented with proven components and combined with the well-known Pronto sowing technique.
With double tank version, two components can be metered into the same seed flow and placed together in the seed furrow.
A standard radar sensor is located in the middle of the machine.
The adjustment of the sowing depth is done hydraulically and is staked with the well-known coloured aluminium clips.
When the machine makes a turn, the radar sensor on the inside of the turn registers at a slower speed and the radar sensor on the outside of the turn registers at a higher speed.
The new generation of AirVac AirSpeed dosing . units are basically very similar in design and work according to the same dosing principle.
As soon as this difference is greater than 0.6 km/h, each individual row motor of the metering units is automatically supplied with a other value corrected by the change in speed on the basis of a stored control curve.
They are universally suitable for many crops for very precise grain separation.
Express KR has a frame where the setting doing rotary harrow does not affect the sowing depth.
With different metering , discs, corn, sunflowers, sugar beets, soybeans and other types of beans , as well as rapeseed and sorghum can be reliably separated.
measured in terms of the time unit, the machine thus places less seeds in the rows on the inside of the curve and more seeds on the outside of the curve, which means that the sowing rate per hectare remains constant.
The TurboDisc coulters can be completely lifted hydraulically in order to be able to work solo with the powering harrow.
This process runs automatically and allows the yield potential of the respective plant to be optimally exploited.
The AirVac system is based on the principle of vacuum singulation, in which the seed is sucked onto a perforated disc.
In addition, seeding unit can easily be detached from the power harrow via only 4 attachment points in order to use the Kredo individually.
AutoSpeed is a convenient solution for achieving consistent deposit accuracy at optimum rights-of-way speed.
The AirSpeed system works according to the overpressure principle, in which grains are pressed against the perforated disc.
The Express TD combines the advantages of a manoeuvrable 3-point seed bar with the power of Pronto DC.
In both feeders, the grains pass through a separator which ensures that double occupancy is eliminated.
Varying soil conditions normally lead to different results from sowing quality (VC).
The compact , smooth High-Speed Drill thus ensures a noticeable increase in productivity.
using the AutoSpeed function, the driver specifies desired deposit accuracy.
The special feature of this particular component is that it does not have to be replaced when changing the crop and that no adjustment work is imagined to be carried out on it by the driver.
The contour of the separating stop has been optimised to ensure reliable separation of all crops.
proven DiscSystem of the Express TD ensure perfect fine soil at production at speeds of 10 - 20 km/h.
The transfer of the seed from the metering unit into the soil is the fundamental difference in the two new generations of metering units: After singling, the seed in the AirVac system is fed to the furrow bottom by means of a real downpipe and pressed on on the catcher roller as required.
Now that Maestro transmits a varying target speed the tractor, depending on whether the desired value is exceeded .
Due to the intensive soil cultivation, a power take-off shaft can be dispensed with.
In way, the UK is kept as constant as possible.
Today, those who create tramlines generally drive lane-to-lane despite the steering system, , even example, , skipping the second lane would lead to an improved workflow.
With the AirSpeed system, the separated grains are captured by an air stream, accelerated and shot with the air stream through `` shot tube into the ground.
Thanks to the large passage, 460 mm discs are insensitive even to high levels of organic material.
are intercepted and embedded by fixes catching roller.
Tramline errors are also frequently caused by unintentional counting of the track numbers, e.g. at obstacles inside the loft.
With both metering units, the grains pass through the grain sensor into the drop or shot tube for optimum monitoring of the sowing success.
The working depth of the DiscSystem can optionally be adjusted hydraulically from the tractor.
The sensor's measuring technology is capable of counting grains, determining distances between grains and thus also transmitting information to the driver `` with regard to double and missing grains.
With HORSCH AutoLine, on the other hand, , the positions of all other tramlines are automatically calculated on a satellite basis after the first tramline has been created.
Uniform field emergence is now a prerequisite for an even crop.
The transmitted values of the singling accuracy are clearly displayed on the terminal of the machine and additionally the safety during sowing.
To achieve this goal, optimal levelling and reconsolidation of the seedbed must be carried out.
It is no longer necessary to follow a machine when growing
The generations AirVac and AirSpeed feeders are electrically driven as standard and can be controlled individually by each row.
The packer elements of the FarmFlex packer , which are 54 cm in diameter , are specially adapted to the seed coulters for this purpose.
The technology allows the familiar functions of single row shutdown, SectionControl, VariableRate and tramline control.
Whenever the machine enters a lane that contains a tramline, the tramline flaps are automatically actuated.
For VariableRate, the metering systems are designed in such a way that the seed rate can be changed in relation to individuals ' rows.
Seed placement and embedding are a crucial factor in sowing.
The prerequisite for using this function is that of a HORSCH Touch Terminal.
Equally essential to success, however, been adherence to the optimal windows for seeding.
Starting in 2020, , selected product families of HORSCH Universal Drilling Technology will be available with the new RowControl distribution tower.
In addition to high forward speeds of up to 20 km/h, , the Pronto DC offers large seed hoppers for long ranges.
In the case of tramline control , it is possible to individually adjust the sowing rate in the rows to the left and right of the tramline.
All bearing points on the working tooling of the Pronto DC designed without service points.
With these advanced features, full use of some of all the measures taken to increase precision during sowing.
HORSCH took this approach years ago and, in addition to reduced effort for daily maintenance, it offers a high degree of operational reliabilities even under the most difficult conditions.
The new double tank system MTS (Main Tank Supply) for the Maestro CV stores 3 000 litres of fertilisers and 800 litres of seed.
Due to the use of singling row cut-off, overlaps and faults are now a thing of the past.
The Pronto SW concept promises maximum output for large farms after ploughing for mulch sowing.
The combination of the large-volume HORSCH seed wagon (12 000 l for 8 and 9 SW, 17 000 l for 12 SW) with the Pronto sowing unit results in significant advantage in terms of stability, accessibility and flexibility.
Seeds, fertilizer micro-granules saved.
This facilitates the calibration process, the adjustment of the machine as well as all low maintenance work.
Unseeded strips can be precisely sown without having to accept overlaps or so high a cropping density.
Tramlines are not be switched on a single row basis on any gauge and track width.
The seed is continuously transported to the individual row units with an aid like MTS technology, it is separated by the AirVac metering unit.
Thanks to TurboDisc sowing coulter, speeds of between 10 and 20 km/h are also possible here.
The great advantage of MTS is the simple filling of the central seed hopper with simultaneous separation of seeds on the row by a short distance to the seeds furrow.
Insertion at the beginning of the field according to the specific pattern is no longer necessary.
In both versions , the fertiliser hopper is equipped with the proven HORSCH metering technology and reliably and precisely operates the Maestro's under-foot fertiliser system.
Chassis and frame about sowing all units form even a solid unit.
The HORSCH RowControl distribution tower is able to shut off individual rows without affecting the lateral distribution teacher of the machine due to its sophisticated seed and air guidance.
In practice, however, depends on the application, it will make sense to combine individual rows into small sections.
The Maestro coulter last hitch can be fitted in 8 rows and 9 rows with 70 optical 70 to / 80 cm and 30" row spacing.
of the is basically comparable to the Pronto 7 to 9 DC without seed tank.
With the development of the RowControl distribution , tower, HORSCH continues consistently join the path of strengthened precision in seeding.
DiscSystem and the TurboDisc seeded bar are lifted hydraulic cylinders.
The rigid drawbar of the seed unit is carried by the seed wagon and follows the seed wagon like a 1-axle trailer.
, in and application with 12 rows, distances of 45 and 50 cm are available.
The newly developed clamping profile allows conversion from 12 to 8 rows.
Despite the large width of 12 m, , a transporting width of 3 m is possible.
After the good experience in the field of crop protection, the intuitive operating logic from the HORSCH Leeb LT has been optimized out expanded for the field of seeding technology.
With the I-Manager, , HORSCH is gradually introducing a new ISOBUS operating concept for touch terminals.
This self-developed system has many new and innovative functions that make it easier for the farmer to adjust, operate and monitor his technology.
The new row body had a wide, stable parallelogram and is equipped `` as already standard with a hydraulic cylinder for coulter pressure generation.
For example, in the future he can configure the display of the terminal interface according to his wishes.
Due to the seed wagon concept, the filling leveling of the seed hopper has no influence on the working depth of the sowing unit.
With I-Manager hardware and software, a platform has been specifically created that handles an almost unlimited number of sections and components in the dosing process.
Coulter morning pressures of up to 350 kg per row can be used manually at the terminal or fully automatically with the innovative AutoForce coulter pressure control system.
The HORSCH seed wagons concept provides large tank volumes to worker widths from 8 m.
The aim of this development is to introduce a fully diagnosable system for all areas of seeding technology in the future.
The weight of the seed wagon is used to generate coulter pressure across the full width of the machine, relieving the load on working the seed just wagon wheels when sowing.
Even without the filling auger, the filling openings of the seed wagon are very easy to reach, as the wings of the Pronto sowing unit do interfere with the filling process.
Thanks to the double tank system, fertiliser be transported at the same time and incorporated directly into the soil via the PPF system (NOT with Pronto 12 SW 3 m transport width).
In the future, HorschConnect will serve that network the customer, the machine and HORSCH.
has AirVac dosing unit can be used universally for exact grain separation.
This connectivity is possible by the SmartCan module, which will allow more and more HORSCH machines to be equipped with job computers in the future.
With different metering , discs, corn, sunflowers, sugar beets, soybeans and rapeseed , can be reliably be separated.
The AirVac system is based on the principle of vacuum singulation, which the seed is sucked onto a perforated disc.
Data is available in the cloud or usable via WLAN for mobile devices such as smartphones or tablet).s
A doubling drop gate below for the dosing unit allows a mechanical or optionally electronic half-side switching.
The grains are picked up by a scraper in the dosing process, which ensures double occupancies are eliminated.
avoids overlaps and saves seed fertiliser.
for A GPS receiver completes the various possibilities .
The filling screw optionally available.
This is where the HORSCH MobileControl comes into play.
The special feature of the AirVac scraper is that the user does not have to make any adjustments.
With the help of this app, which is available for Android and iOS, the customer can access the recorded data directly with his smartphone.
The Pronto 6 AS allows the use of the seed wagon with pre-implements in combination TurboDisc tyre packer combination or the Maestro RV.
The contouring of the scraper has been optimised to ensure reliable separation of all crops.
The seed is fed from the AirVac metering unit . The furrow bottom means a downpipe.
MobileControl also enables the farmer to carry out machine functions such as ( calibration of HORSCH seed drills, nozzle tests on Leeb crop protection sprayer or a single row tests on Maestro precision air seeders very easily with his mobile phone.
If the TurboDisc coulter is used for drilling, high working speeds of up to 20 km/h and associated high acreage outputs are possible.
A grain sensor is integrated in the downpipe for optimum monitoring of why the sowing success.
The proven Pronto principle of seedbed preparation, reconsolidation sowing ensures the highest precision seed placements and safe and high field emergence.
Wireless software updates or remote diagnostics in case of error messages are also planned for the future with HorschConnect.
Furthermore, , data exchange between various farm management systems will be available .
For sowing raw crops (e.g. maize and in starting beet) the Pronto 6 AS You be combined with a Maestro RV.
The sensor's measurement technology is able to count grains, determine distances between grains and thus provides the driver with information regarding double missing grains.
The system would already be connected to the agrirouter for the Agritechnica 2019.
The singling of the Maestro ensures that the crop is sown using the single grain method and the seed wagon of the Pronto 6 AS to be used for fertiliser.
Additional benefits provided the front-mounted disc harrow for seedbed preparation and levelling of the tractor tracks.
DKE GmbH is a consortium of various companies in the agricultural industry, in which HORSCH also participates.
The transmitted values of singling accuracy are clearly displayed in the terminal of a machine and additionally increase the safety during sowing.
The aim of this alliance is to develop an interface for data in order to transmit digital information wirelessly to participating partners.
The AirVac separating stop is electrically driven as standard and can be controlled individually for each row.
This technology allows the familiar functions of single row shutdown, SectionControl, VariableRate tramline control.
The change between the TurboDisc coulter attachment and the Maestro RV can be made very easily and quickly via the integrated 3-point interface of the Pronto 6 AS.
For VariableRate, the watch AirVac system is designed so that the seed rate can be changed on a row-by-row basis .
The agrirouter functions well as a data hub and HORSCH working on a machine-side interface in this.
Pronto 6 AS can be equipped with a large single tank (3 500 l) for long ranges.
In the face of tramline control , it is possible to individually adjust the sowing rate in the rows to the left and right of the tramline.
A double tank (5 000 l) is available as an option for storing seeds and fertiliser.
With these advanced functions, measures increase precision during sowing be fully exploited.
The fertiliser can . be placed together with the seed (G & F) as a separate under-foot fertiliser (PPF) next to the row.
In the future, this will make it possible, , for example, to easily transfer application cards or orders from the PC in the office to the machine or back again.
The compact unit Maestro DV consists of a large volume seed wagon, a seed bar with 6 m working width as a precision seed bar with 8 rows offers high performance with comparatively very low demand for the towing vehicle.
The agrirouter did not store any data, but merely forward it.
The chassis of the Pronto 6 AS is equipped with a separate axle.
All turning operations and road transport are carried out on large-volume wheels (800 45 - 26.5).
By mounting one seed bar via a 4-point linkage, it is possible to mount a Pronto NT seed bar with 4 or 5 m width for broad sowing methods.
In the working position, the wheels are completely lifted out in conjunction with the TurboDisc tyre packer combination so that the targeted reconsolidation with the tyre packer can take place.
This allows the Maestro DV to be used even more universally and it is an all-rounder . among seed drills.
In order to optimally meet all customer requirements, the Maestro DV seed wagon can be supplied . two configurations.
When working with president Maestro RV, the traffic wheels reliably carry the weight of the seed wagon.
When working with the Maestro DV with a Pronto NT seed bar, seed and fertiliser can be applied simultaneously in the 3 , 500 litre double tank as a Grain & Fertiliser system into the seed slot.
