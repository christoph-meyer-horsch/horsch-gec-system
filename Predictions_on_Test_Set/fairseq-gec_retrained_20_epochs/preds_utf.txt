The user always retains absolute control of the data.
Alternatively, two different fertiliser components can be applied with the double hopper with the single grain sowing bar via the under-foot fertiliser application device.
Just as with seeding technology and crop protection, a tillage solution from HORSCH help you achieve your individual requirements and goals of arable farming in the best possible way.
In addition, integration of a consultant or contractors into the data flow is possible, for example.
The Pronto 6 body AS shows its advantages to the full, espcially on contract farms and farms with a long distance between areas.
This place has the highest demands on our cultivators and disc harrows.
In the version tank is equipped with the proven HORSCH metering technology and can precisely operate the Maestro's under-foot fertiliser system or seeding bar.
This is a remarkable step towards standardizing the often company-specific development in data exchange between machines and software products from different manufacturers.
The Pronto 6 / 8 / 9 NT enables mulches and direct sowing with the proven TurboDisc in a compact design without seed wagons.
This applies to research, design and development as well as to assembly, service and consulting.
The in-line body of the Maestro DV has a wide, stable parallelogram and is equipped with springs for coulter pressure generation as standard.
Thanks to working speeds of up to 20 km/h, a high area output can be achieved even with smaller working widths.
HORSCH is part of this development towards a simple and safe digital agriculture.
HORSCH seed drills are compatible with CLAAS Telematics.
The corrugated ech / cutting discs cut organic material and the soil only in the seed rows.
We take the time since extensive studies, go once again with the technology also on our own farms with over 6,000 ha in the field to experience for ourselves what we are developing and what we were talking about.
Coulter pressure of up to 260 kg per row can thus be achieved mechanically.
As soon as a HORSCH machine is connected to a CLAAS tractor, data on application rates, areas worked and sowing quality transmitted the CLAAS Telematics module via the ISOBUS.
This result was a very low tractive force of requirement.
Optionally, machines can be equipped with hydraulic cylinders for coulter pressure generation.
This information is transmitted to the server with the tractor data and the position.
Thus, with the innovative coulter pressure control system AutoForce, the coulter pressure settings are made up to a maximum of 350 kg per row.
The generously dimensioned seed hopper (4 000 l) guarantees short downtimes allows sufficient cutting disc pressure even without additional ballasting.
We take responsibility in agriculture and share the feelings of our customers - this is what we passionate about.
In way, the customer can monitor his tractor but also his HORSCH seed drill or HORSCH Maestro in the CLAAS Telematics portal.
The weight of the seed wagon is used to generate coulter pressure across the full width of the machine, relieving load of the seed wagon wheels when sowing.
This data transmits via the sophisticated machine hydraulics.
The Maestro is universally suitable for a wide range of crops due to its precise grain separation.
Seeding performance and process data are displayed and evaluated in tables for or maps.
The agricultural origin is making HORSCH and its products the best optimal solution for soil cultivation.
This created a manufacturer-independent documentations analysis of the option.
If necessary, additional weights of 400 kg can be mounted by the frame.
AutoSelect HORSCH proprietary nozzle circuit.
The proven seed wagon concept is still unique and unmatched at design.
Due to flexible frame parts the seeding unit has an exact ground adaptation.
All machines can be perfectly adapted to their requirements (soils, climate, a farm sizes...).
During the nozzles and the pressure range, farmers can also set the target area distance.
The two new HORSCH metering Systems offer the greatest possible individualization and optimal adaptation possibilities for farm-specific conditions.
Multiple nozzle carriers and a 25 cm pitch on the nozzle bar offer a wide range of possibilities.
The new generation of AirVac and AirSpeed dosing units are basically very similar in design and according to the same dosing principle.
The Joker is ideally suited for shallow stubble cultivation for germination stimulation of volunteer cereals, interruption of which capillarity, mixing in crop residues and for shallow seedbed preparation.
With the double tank version (5 000 l), seed and fertiliser (G to F) are applied as a simultaneously.
It produces a high percentage of fine soil in the germination horizon and is not susceptible to disturbance even when exposed to high amounts of straw, organic fertilizers or catch crops.
They are universally suitable for many crops for the precise grain separation.
In addition, a micro-granulate device is available to apply for further component.
Individual or different nozzle positions can be combined in profiles.
The short disc harrow is available as Joker CT 3-point linkage.
With metering discs, corn, sunflowers, sugar beets, soybeans and other types of beans as well as rapeseed and sorghum can be reliably separated.
The micro-granulate device can be combined with a double and single tank versions.
Up to 16 profiles were controlled.
High outputs are possible above all due to work speeds of up to 20 km/h.
The AirVac systems are based on the principle of vacuum singulation, which the seed is sucked on a perforated disc.
In addition to three components (seed, fertiliser, micro-granulate) can be metered of one operation.
This ensures that the optimum pressure range for the nozzle or nozzle combination used and its optimum target area distance are always guaranteed when the driving speed changed.
The Pronto NT is a compact universal seed drill with Pronto system (cultivation, sowing and pressing) for mulch and direct sowing.
AirSpeed system works according to the overpressure principle, in which the grains are pressed against the perforated disc.
The machines of the future think for themselves and HORSCH Intelligence make it possible.
As an additional option for the Joker 3, 3.5 and 4 CT rigid, there is the single-bar deep loosener Mono TG.
no-till conditions, the tooled combination of the Wellsech For cutting disc and the proven TurboDisc coulter has decisive advantages.
feeders, the grains pass to the separator which ensures that double occupancy is eliminated.
It is particularly suitable for heavy sites where the soil needs to be deeply loosened but you only want to mix in crop residues shallowly.
Soil is the only tilled where seed is subsequently placed.
With intelligent solutions software and electronics, HORSCH machines workplace even more efficiently and help you save money and nerves.
The roller goes over the complete working width.
HORSCH technology is always equipped with ISOBUS standard.
The special feature of this particular component is that it does not have to be replaced when changing the crop and that no adjustment work needs to be carried out on it by the driver.
This is not only meant that every HORSCH machined can be controlled with some ISOBUS terminal.
It was a diameter of 300 mm 6 knives per roller for a very high speed, to additionally improve the shredding effect.
HORSCH TurboDisc coulters effectively adapt to uneven ground, ensure coulter pressure and precise seed placement.
The blades are arranged at a slight angle and constant force distribution.
The contour separating this has been optimised not to ensure reliable separation for crops.
For maximum stability, the blades rest against the rotor.
The transfer of the seed from the metering unit into the soil is the fundamental difference in the two new generations of metering units: After singling, the seed in the AirVac system was fed into the furrow bottom by means of a downpipe and pressed by the catcher roller as required.
In addition, every HORSCH machine with a job computer is capable of executing functions such as SectionControl, VariableRate or job processing with TaskController as soon as the necessary licenses have been activated.
Two types of PPF systems are available to spread the fertiliser.
The whole system remains hydraulically preloaded with 100 bar and hydraulically protected against overload.
The ISOBUS SectionControl function enables automatic sectioning control.
With the AirSpeed system, the separated grains are captured by an air stream, accelerated and shot with the air stream passing the shot tube into the ground.
The new pre-implement is perfect, for example, for shredding catch crops in spring autumn and for ultra-flat stubble know cultivation in rape, sunflowers or silage maize.
They were intercepted embedded in the fixed roller.
The knife roller is also suitable for corn borer control in the silage maize stubble.
On the one hand, the fertiliser can be applied together with the seed by the TurboDisc coulters real or, as an equipment option, separately depth-adjustable fertiliser discs among the seed rows.
The current position of the machine is determined via GPS.
With the metering units, the grains pass through a grain sensor in the drop or that shot tube for optimum monitoring of the sowing success.
The sensor's measuring technology is capable of counting grains, determining distances between grains and thus also transmitting information to the driver with regard to double and missing grains.
The Terrano FX is a compact universal cultivator which, thanks to the use of different coulter systems, is suitable both for shallow, all-over stubble cultivation and for intensive loosening and mixing at the depths of 5 to 30 cm.
At the edge of the field, at the headland or in case of obstacles, part-width sections (single row shut-off only with Maestro) or would the entire working widths are automatically shut off, thus avoiding overlaps.
Due to its 3-bar, stable frame construction with high clearance, the Terrano FX homogeneously mixes in crop residues even under diffucult conditions.
Due to the direct connection between seed wagon and sowing unit you have high coulter pressure the concords cutting discs and fertiliser coulters even without additional ballast.
With the Serto SC, HORSCH offer a compacts seeding technology of 10 and 12 m widths without pre-moulds.
As the ISOBUS TaskController, data can be transferred easily from the PC to the terminal.
In the same way it is possible to transfer application rates, sown area and other data recorded during sows from the terminal to the PC and to document them.
The transmitted values of the singling accuracy are clearly displayed in the terminals of the machine and additionally increase the safety during sowing.
The longer soil retention was in the Terrano FX compared to 2-bar models and the special shape of the coulters ensure an optimised mixing effect.
Its central features are a sophisticated folding technique and continuous tyre packer in combination with heavy double disc coulter.
This facilitates the maintenance of the land using plan index.
Similar to the proven Pronto system, two sows coulters knew 16.6 cm row space was running behind each tyre.
Uniform levelling and deeps reconsolidation round off the working quality Terrano and achieve an optimum seedbed beginning every pass.
Orders can be created processing via an integrated order management.
The new generations in AirVac and AirSpeed feeders electrically drive as standard and can be controlled individually for each row.
This technology allows the familiar functions of single row shutdown, SectionControl, and tramline control.
To ensure uniform depth placement, the Serto is a packer for levelling job reconsolidation.
DLG Fokus Test is already certified to Terrano FX's absolute lightness of 2003.
For VariableRate the metering systems are designed in such a way that the seed rate can be changed by each individual row.
The new HORSCH PowerDisc coulter is perfectly suited for difficult conditions and ensures reliable seed placement even in coarse seedbeds with coulter pressure of up to 150 kg per individual row.
ISOBUS VariableRate function enables the application of seed or ` that fertiliser.
With the best work quality, the Terrano FX needs of 20% less diesel than the average consumption off all test candidates.
It has a high long-lasting stabilities due to a very large dimensioned bearing and construction.
Here, the experience gained from the Maestro single grains technology flowed into the design.
In the case of tramline control, it is possible to individually adjust the sowing rate in the rows to the left and right of the tramline.
With advanced features, full use can be made of all the measures it takes to increase precision during sowing.
The total tank volume for the Serto is 6 000 litres divided by 60 40.
Different coulter systems, which have changed quickly and have been optimised for specific areas of application (shallow, full-surface, deep, intensive mixing), give the Terrano FX a wide range of applications in terms of both working depth and working quality.
In this way, his optimum amount of fertiliser and seed can be applied to each sub-area within a field using a suitable application map.
Just as with soil cultivation and Horsch seeding technology, the crop protection solution from HORSCH you have to achieve your individual requirements and goals in arable farming in the best possible way.
When using a HORSCH Touch 800 or 1200 terminal, the MultiControl function can also be used.
We place the highest demands on our Leeb sprayers, they are self-propelled cropping protection sprayers or trail sprayers.
This means that either 6 000 litres of seed can be spread or seed and fertiliser in combination with a tank layout of 3 600 litres at the front and 2 400 litres at rear.
This applies to research, design and development as well as to assembly, service and consulting.
This very Terrano FX is guided precisely in depth to the tractor hydraulics but the packer roller.
For a third component is an optional 300 litre tank for micro granules.
If SectionControl is activated, MultiControl allows an independent switching North and off of seed and fertiliser.
The depth is adjusted by means of the proven AluClips, which limit the lowering depth of the cultivator frame into relation to the packer.
Track eradicator tines or corrugate disc track eradicators are available effective loosening of the tracks of the tractor.
If the sowing is carried out site-specifically with VariableRate, MultiControl varies the amount of fertiliser and seed independently of each other.
We take the time for extensive studies, go once again with the technology and also our own farms with over 6,000 ha of the field - to experience for ourselves we are developing and what we are talking about.
The pair of corrugated discs are ideal, on heavy soils, as no coarse structures are broken from the seedbed and the tolerance for crop residue is particularly high.
A robust TerraGrip tine ensures constant coulter guidances car has the desired working depth.
Without MultiControl, seed or fertiliser can be switched on and off at the right time with SectionControl or seed or fertiliser can be varied with VariableRate.
We take responsibility in agriculture and say the feelings of our costomer - this is what we are passionate about.
The machine is folded to a transport widths of 3 m at the push of a button.
The machines of the future think for themselves and HORSCH Intelligence make English possible.
The coulters are sure of the gentle mixing of the soil.
The country tractive power requirement is absolutely low even on light soils due to continuous packer that saves fuel.
Due to the optimised arrangement of the disc levelling, "straw swaths" are avoided and the surface is evenly levelled.
This agricultural origin has HORSCH its products in plant protection for optimal solution.
With intelligent solutions through freesoft and electronics, HORSCH machines work efficiently so you can save money and nerves.
The Terrano's beam design transfers the tines' pull-in forces without loss to the packer, where they are used to deep, strip reconsolidation.
The narrow seed hopper provides easy access to the components that allow a perfect view of the machine and field.
HORSCH of technology is always equipped with the ISOBUS standard.
The Terrano FM is suitable for shallow stubble cultivation to medium deep soil cultivation, depending on the tractor power.
All machines on this can be perfectly adapted to your requirements (soils, climate, farm sizes,....).
This is not meant that every HORSCH machine can be controlled with any ISOBUS terminal.
For the power, Serto 12 SW is available from large volume seed wagons called (17 000 l).
It achieves an intensive mixture due to the 4-bar structure and still remains lightly drawn by a line spacing of 27 cm.
In addition, every HORSCH machine with a job computer is capable of executing functions such as for SectionControl, VariableRate or job processing with the TaskController as soon as the necessary licenses have been activated.
Achieving more in the shortest possible time with fewer machines - thanks to this strategy, today's entrepreneurs are able to operate successfully and remain competitive.
The Terrano FM is a large passage to blockage-free working with larger quantities of crop residues.
As a manufacturer of crop protection technology, it is our goal to support farmers and entrepreneurs with efficient and precise technology.
Our developers do their utmost to offer right solutions to the special requirements of application technology in the crop protection sector and to design a powerful and flexible machine for a wide range of applications.
It is equipped in the third generation that TerraGrip tines - these stand for precise coulter guidance through high release forces.
ISOBUS SectionControl function enables an automatic section of the control.
The result is a new generation of Leeb PT that combines driving comfort, performance and maximum application efficiency.
With the three-part tank there is a possibility of contact fertilisation or the application of mixtures.
The Serto 12 SW also relies on the PowerDisc coulter for working without pre-tools at high coulter pressure up to 150 kg.
Due to large dimensioned the pivot points they maintenance-free and such very robust.
The current position of the machine is determined via GPS.
The new PT leaves nothing to be desired and offers more possibilities than ever before: more ground clearance, more driving comfort, more climbing ability, more choice in working width.
The proven MulchMix coulter ensures an excellent mixing effects with lowing tractive power requirements.
In the field, the Terrano FM turns on the packer, which ensures maximum soil protection at the headland.
The edge of the field, at the headland or in cases of obstacles, part-width sections or the entire width are automatically switched off, thus avoiding overlaps.
In short, the PT offers universal variability for the highest demands in terms of both technology and driving experience.
Due to the hydraulic weight transfer, the weight of the seed wagon is automatically transferred to the side wings so thus evenly to all seed coulters.
With the ISOBUS TaskController, data can be transferred easily from paper to the PC to terminal.
The HORSCH Shuttle made him shine.
The turret chassis swings HALLS down for road travel and swaps positions in the middle of packer segment.
In the same way it is possible to transfer application rates, sown area and other data recorded during sow from the terminal the PC and to document them.
one-shot process, exactly one filling is always transported to the point of application.
The undercarriage is located near the machine and ensures high stability and driving comfort during transport.
Depending on the farm structure, the output of the crop protection sprayer increases significantly.
Thus, despite seed waggon, most pressure can be applied to each individual seed coulter.
The time of road trip and the purging process missing.
This facilitates the maintenance of the land use planning index.
The disc levelling system of maintenance-free oil bath bearing ensures uniform soil levelling even before the packer.
The large-volume pump on the shuttle ensures the transfer process within a few minutes and subsequently provides the time required for the correct, error-free flushing of the various brewing components when preparing the work next "shot".
Orders can be created in this process via integrated order management.
The rest is done on the Terrano FM by the very robust and sophisticated double RollPack packer.
Due to the Serto concept with the continuous packer, the ease of pulling the Serto SC is also given here.
The specially arranged baffles, the sway-free attachment to the truck and the perfect balance provided by the laterally separate fresh water tanks ensure smooth, safe driving even at top speed.
Due to its stable design, it is suitable for almost all types of soil.
The ISOBUS VariableRate function enables site-specific application seeds and fertiliser.
Track loosening discs out the tracks on the seed wagon and ensure equal conditioning for all PowerDisc coulters.
With attached high-pressure cleaner, dirty machines can be easily cleaned in field.
interlock packer rings ensure good self-cleaning.
In this way, the optimum amount of fertiliser and seed can be applied to each sub-area within a field using a suitable application map.
Work peaks in tight time frames require a high impact on each individual area.
When a HORSCH Touch 800 in 1200 terminal, the MultiControl function can also be used.
The depth control is comfortably carried hydraulically via packer and the pendulum support wheels.
Large field distances, high application rates during induction again reduces the performance of the crop protection sprayer.
If SectionControl is to activated, MultiControl allows independents switching on and off of seeding and fertiliser.
This enables uniform depth placement across the entire working width and, in combinations with the hydraulic weights transfer, creates the prerequisite for homogeneous field emergence.
The proven aluminium clips are clamped to stumble the cylinders example for precise adjustment.
Unavoidable downtimes increases costs at the same time to reduce the time for optimal application.
If the sow is carried out site-specifically with VariableRate, MultiControl vary the amount of fertiliser and seed independently of each other.
The HORSCH operator has never lost sight of the products that have made its reputation for 30 years: the first seeding impactors have left in the last impression.
Despite enormous working width, the Terrano FM has a transport width of metres with a frame height of 600 mm and 3.63 metres with a frame height of 750 mm.
With Shuttle 8 000 L, everyone can concentrate on their core competence and the machines perform in the area of greatest strength.
Going back to the early days of the company, Michael Horsch developed and built a machine that was suitable for direct seeding.
The arguments the time were: minimise soil encroachment, promote soil life and, in the context of falling prices for agricultural products, of course, cost savings.
Without MultiControl, either seed or fertiliser can be switched on and off at the right time with SectionControl seed or fertiliser days can be varied with VariableRate.
As a 365 FarmNet customer, you can use the HORSCH FillAssist function in your 365 App.
With the opening of the Eastern markets for the 1990s, there was suddenly a large market for no-till technology.
While the shuttle currently increases existing capacities in farms with the highest workload peaks, than future it will take on leading role in crop protection.
The lie of the third generation TerraGrip tines.
The introduction of autonomous crop protection sprayers in segregated areas away from public roads and busy infrastructure has significantly more hurdles to overcome than the necessary feed ring solution.
The 3 m version tines with a passage of 60 cm, the 3.63 version has tines with a passage of 75 cm.
However, to the large areas in east, the PTO-driven technology is not for applicable.
The shuttle is the first practical interface of the human-controlled to computer-controlled part of plant protection.
As soon as a planned crop protection measure is called up in the app, a required agent quantity and the required number of tank fillings for the job are calculated depending on the tank size of your crop protection sprayer.
The HORSCH Shuttle convinces with its compact design, high impact force during filling in the field and precise metering.
As a result, the tines have different release forces - 630 kg for the 3 m version with the 600 tine handle and 515 kg for the 3.63 m version of the 750 tine handle.
With the experience of gaining it from no-till, Michael Horsch developed tine-based no-till technology for the eastern markets, which successfully sold there today.
This means that you always have all the information you need to fill the syringe you need on your tablet.
The divisible container helps the close transport of two different goods and their separate emptying.
You can select or deselect strokes from the planned measure of the calculations are automatically adjusted.
In the recent past, all considerations arose to direct seed drills with disc coulters.
In request, the control of the gate is electric.
Worked-off plot can be marked and partial plots can be entered.
Terrano GX a defined all-rounder, which works perfectly for shallow as well as deep soil cultivation up to 25 cm.
Firstly, to the Latin American markets, to minimise soil encroachment and protect against erosion.
While augers place greater mechanical stress on the goods being transferred and often considerably reduced quality, the conveyor belt is gentle on seed and fertiliser and can be emptied completely due to the shaped flights.
Terrano GX is available as a 3- and 4-bar universal cultivators and thus combines the requirements of every customer.
But also in other regions for single disc coulter technology is highly interesting - especially in Europe with increasing requirements in the area of intercrop seeding or seeding of main crops in intercrops in regions with the challenge of resistant weeds.
widths range from 4 to 6 in metres.
Whether fertilisers is to be delivered to the field for start-up, seed and fertiliser are to be transported to the seed drill or temporary grain is to be moved away quickly, flexible use is the key.
Parts of England, Germany and France were in need of new seeding technologies with reduced ground movement - a very clear task for the Avatar.
It is equipped with the third generation TerraGrip tine, which lies flat on the frame and has a release force of 550 kg.
Due to the standardised coupling points on the truck, the shuttles can be exchanged at will and can be dismantled / assembled in a simple steps using a forklift or telescopic loader.
In this way, the remaining required quantity of spray liquid for the entire job and for the currently processed field can be updated and displayed.
large-dimensioned pivot points to ensure a better service of life.
Disc coulter thechnologic plays an important role in large parts of Russia, Kazakhstan and China.
All functions of the basic language remain unchanged.
The cultivator is equipped with many coulter variants, so that it is ready to use at any time of year and can cope with the most varied soil conditions worldwide.
For the next tank filling, whether full or partial, the average quantities are displayed so that the calculation does not have to be made in the head or by calculator.
The tilting function and the funnel-shaped design ensure that the container can be emptied completely.
undercarriage of the Terrano GX are located behind the tine field, in front of the levelling tools.
Insertable grid sieves ensured the quality of goods will be transported.
These are all reasons for our HORSCH company to develop its own avatar family.
The chassis with its large-dimensioned tyres is used both for road transport and for turning at headland.
The large dimensioned conveyor belt is characterized on the one hand by the fully variable overloading height, and on the other hand by overloads capacity.
The sophisticate kinematics of the undercarriage ensure both high ground clearance when raised and safe swinging of the tyres out of the area in the lower position.
The HORSCH company has never lost sight of the products that have made a reputation for 30 years: the First seeder-exactors left a lasting impression.
Going back to the early days of the company, Michael Horsch got built a machine that was suitable for direct seeding.
The new HORSCH Titan 34 UW reloading wagon stands for harvesting power in a new dimension.
The position of the chassis is chosen to ensure good manoeuvrability in a field and a high level of driving comfort in the road.
In order to make optimum use of the tractive power to bring the available power to the ground, the Terrano GX is equipped with a tractive power booster, which permanently presses 1 200 kg on the rear axle of the tractor when working.
He inherited the genes of the HORSCH reloading wagons and raised them to a completely new technical level.
The arguments at the time were: minimise soil encroachment, promote soil life and, in the context of falling prices for agricultural products, course, cost savings.
If the traction booster is required, because flatter is being carried out, it can be switched off at any time by means of a shut-off valve.
Thanks to the large tank volume of 34 mÂ³, waiting time at the edge of the field and awkward manoeuvring there will be a thing of the past in future.
This is activated simply depressurizing the control unit for lifting and lowering, without additional control unit or cylinders.
With the opening of the Eastern markets in 1990s, true patients have a large market for no-till technology.
The tank volume of the UW corresponds to the tea truck load.
However, the large area in the east, the PTO-driven technology is not applicable.
For levelling, there is a choice between the oil-bath mounted discs, aggressively spread the material in front of the packer, or the levellers, which spread the material to ensure perfect levelling.
These are thus filled with swoop.
With the experience gained no-till, Michael Horsch developed tine-based technology for the eastern markets, which still successfully sold there today.
The newly designed hydraulically folding screw conveyors (Ã¸ 600 mm) has a capacity of 18 tons per minute, which corresponds to a gigantic 000 tons per hour!
The Terrano GX will be designed best to be equipped with a single or double packer.
In recent past, firsts considerations arose to develop direct seed drilling disc coulters.
Thus, of the 34 mÂ³ are reloads in only 90 seconds.
For this purpose, new packer variants have been developed to cover every spectrum of use.
Firstly, to the Latin American markets, to minimise soil encroachment and protect against erosion.
During field travel, auger is folded down and stored securely in a support.
But also in other regions the singling disc coulter technology is highly interesting - especially in Europe with increasing requirements in the area of intercrop seed or seeding of main crops in intercrops or in regions with the challenge of resistant weeds.
For work in wet conditions or to order winter furrow, is the option to remove every second ring on the RingFlex packer.
In the position, the bent worm does not protrude to either side.
The tiny contact area prevents reconsolidation and clogging of the packers and guide the machine in depth.
The width of road travel is less than three metres.
Parts of England, Germany and France are in need of new seeding technologies with reduced soil movement effects - a very clear area of responsibility for the Avatar
Disc coulter technology also plays an important role in large parts of Russia, Kazakhstan and China.
These are all reasons for the HORSCH company to develop its own avatar family.
The Titan 34 UW (in the wheel version) comes with telescopic axles as standard.
The packer program for the Terrano GX has been further expanded.
Farm specializations, farm expansions, farm communities: the structural change in agriculture is progressing rapidly and is also presenting agricultural engineering with a completely new tasks.
This moves the tyre outwards by 30 cm.
RingFlex Packer two SteelDisc and Packer are available as single as packers.
Optimisation of soil cultivation, sowing and harvesting techniques as well as cost reduction are the requirements of the same time increasing yields and improving the quality of the harvested crop.
The vehicle width thus increases from 3 m to 3.56 m.
The newly advanced SteelFlex Packer, Double RingFlex Packer and Double RollPack Packer are available as doubling to packer variants.
This increased stability and reduces ground pressure, as the tyres of the trans-shipment trailer do not run into the tractors track.
The Terrano MT is designed especially for the "mix top, loosen on the bottom" application.
The cultivator has a central chassis and a 4-bar superstructure (2 rows of disc + 2 rows of tines).
Another means of protecting ground are the large-dimension tyres (900 / 60 R 32).
As a developer and pioneer, HORSCH has been one of the leading manufacturers of tillage and seeding technology.
It is particularly suitable for working heavy soils that need to be deeply loosened, but on which crop residues can only be mixed in shallowly to prevent some coarse soil from transporting the surface.
The optional track undercarriage is available for maximum footprint.
In addition, the 2-row enables shallow and intensively mixing soil cultivation and blockage-free working with difficult residues and high straw quantities.
Innovative ideas from practice to practice - how technology systems and high-grade machines are created which correspond to the latest findings in terms of quality, robustness and durability.
Other features include an integrated high weighing device, a pneumatic braking system and clearly visible indicator for opening status of the screw conveyor slide.
The DiscSystem produces a lot of fine soil and the working depth can be infinitely adjusted hydraulically.
From the platform on the drawbar you can climb upped or on the wagon via ladder.
It is followed by a 2-bar zinc system.
In addition, HORSCH advises companies on the development of individual management concepts and process chains - and, together with its sales and service partners, ensuring seamless support, the fastest possible repairs and an immediate supply of spare parts.
This is relatively easy to pull due to the large line space between 40 cm and 40 mm narrow LD (low disturbance) coulters.
The trolley has steps of the auger so that it can be climbed into cleaning or maintenance.
A generation with which seedbed preparation, sowing and fertilised can be managed in one operation.
The HORSCH seed wagon with the family is characterized by its easy calibration, fast and safe filling due to large filling openings and comfortable walkways.
In the first two rows of the Terrano MT there are disc harrow followed by two rows of TerraGrip tines with narrowing LD (low disturbance) shares.
Short set-up times and capacity of 12,000 to 21,000 litre result in maximum impact in power for large-scale operation of all kinds.
The robust tines seed drill has its strengths above the mulch sowing.
The choice of double or triple tank and the liquid fertiliser option allows the farmer to choose the perfect fertiliser and seed combination for sowing.
The sturdy frame construction with light-weight seed coulters and large-volume seed hoppers enables high acreage output with an optimum cost-benefit ratio.
Various pneumatic systems allow the coupling to a wide range of HORSCH seed drills and soil tillage implements.
The HORSCH SteelDisc packer is used as a maximum reconsolidation.
Especially in HORSCH seeding technology the Tripletank seed wagons stand out due to their high level of tank use.
With Sprinter, you can only bundle time-consuming work processes into a single operation.
It enables intensive loosening up to a depth of 30 cm with a low mixing effect.
They allow precise placement of fertilizer (PPF system) under the seed rows as well as the possibility to become a fertilizer starter with one seed (G and F).
At the same time you also increase the precision in seed placement and fertilisation.
Carefully work tyre packers ensure the optimum soil contact of the seed.
The SW 12000 is a flexible solution of carrying and spreading large quantities of fertiliser and seed.
Coarse soil is thus hardly transported to surface and disc harrow horizon `` undercut.
New Ultra LD coulters further enhance the effect.
The use of the Sprinter leads not only to significant savings but also to a more uniform field emergence and more resistant seedlings (HORSCH PPF system).
They break up the soil and no longer convey clods to the top.
In this way, you create the ideal conditions for fully exploit and securing the expected earnings potential.

The soil is loosened, with this leveled, mixed and crushed like a cultivator.
The design in the rear tank allows an optimum view of the implements.
The position of the chassis is chosen to ensure manoeuvrability in the field and have a high level of driving comfort on the road.
The MiniDrill was developed to turn the soil tillage implement into a precise seed drill with little effort.
In what seeding area, are remove stones, coarse soil chunks crop residues of the seeding horizon.
In order to be able to use the tractive power optimally and bring it to the ground, the Cruiser XL is equipped with a fully integrated tractive power booster, which presses permanently with 1 200 kg of the rear axle of the tractor when working.
It has 400 litre pressure tank for uniformly high application rate of 160 kg/ha.
The seeds are placed precisely in this area where the plants can develop its roots unhindered.
This is activated simply by depressurizing the control unit for lifting lowering - without additional control units or cylinders.
The pressure tank significantly reduces segregation of seed mixtures, are becoming more and more popular.
For an optimum coverage of the seed after the seed coulters and an even distribution of the loose soil and crop residues over the seed bands, a 2-row harrow is used the Sprinter (on the Sprinter 8 ST and 12 SW this is done via disc levelling).
The Cruiser SL is a new specialist for shallow tillage in 3-point in working widths of 4, 5 and 6 metres.
The metering unit of the Pronto uses the appropriate metering shaft to feed the seed directly into the distribution system, where it is evenly distributed via baffle plates in front of the packer.
Our packers ensure an optimal seedbed through their methods of operation, that nothing stands in the way of a problem-free emergence.
With a maximum working depth of 15 cm, it is equally suitable for perfect stubble cultivation with optimum straw distribution after combine threshing, seedbed preparation, as a fine cultivator for mechanical weed control They for loosening and aerating the soil in spring.
The harrow can be adjusted in height aggressiveness.
For optimum lateral distribution, there are six evenly distributed outlets in front of the packer up to 3 m working width and 12 outlets from 4 m working width.
Cruiser levels are excellently due to its 4-beam design.
Due to the special design of the tine above the frame, it achieves a passage of 70 cm, which considerably increase the passage in the fine cultivators area.
Finally, a tandem packer press when seed band.
For special solutions, the MiniDrill Solo is available with a central downpipe, allowing the MiniDrill to be coupled directly to the distribution tower.
The packer is arranged so many tyre runs exactly behind the sowing coulter.
In this way, the seeds of each individual seed band are pressed and receive an optimum soil seal.
The narrow line spacing of 16 cm ensures an optimum mixing ratio and perfect crumbling on the surface.
Another upgrade for our Cruiser SL is our new RingFlex Packer, with its wide rings of 7 cm when it has a high contact area.
The outlet is supplied by the very quiet hydraulic blower, which gets up to 25 l/min and can therefore be operated with any tractor.
The tires have AS tread and are filled with air.
The control is simply carried out via the familiar operating screen of the HORSCH seeding technology.
This means that accurate depth control but lighter conditions are no problem.

That is whies though we are working on the automation and connectivity of our machined with an enlarged development team in the field of system engineering.
This means that at field boundaries, headlands, overlaps or for defined areas, can parallelograms be automatically lifted individually.
Here are more seed wagons and seeding units with a compact unit.
Just as in tillage and crop protection, the seeding solutions HORSCH help you to make your individual requirements and goals in arable farming in the best possible way.
Sprinter 11 / 15 NT also have a slightly smaller seed wagon with a capacity of 12 000 litres.
We attach great importance to reliability or components and functions.
Farm specializations, farm expansions, farm communities: The structural change in agriculture is progressing rapidly and also presenting agricultural engineering with completely fresh tasks.
We place the highest demands of sowing machines - 3-point machines, universal furrow/disc sowing technology, tine sowing technology and precision seed drills.
Our goal is to continuously improve the ease of operation and productivity of HORSCH machines see electronics, software and telemetric data connections, while at the same time continually reducing electronics-related failures.
Optimisation in soil cultivation, sowing and harvesting techniques as well as cost reduction are the requirements - while at the same time increasing yields improving the quality of the harvested crop.
This applies to research, design and development as well as to assembly, service and consulting.
To ensure the smooth electronic coupling of our machines in tractors and farm management software, we are together with many other agricultural machinery manufacturers in the AEF on the practical standardization of ISOBUS and data interfaces.
We take the time for extensive studies, go once again with technology on our own farms with over 6,000 ha in the field to experience for ourselves what we are developping up and what we are talking about.
In the following we present some current and future functions and products from our electronics development areas of sowing technology, crop protection technology and telemetry.
As a developer and pioneer, HORSCH has become one of the leading manufacturers of tillage in seed technology.
We take responsibility in agriculture and share feelings of our customers - this is what we are passionate about.
Innovative ideas of practice to practice - this is how technology systems and high-grade machines are created which correspond to the latest findings in terms of quality, robustness and durability.
The agricultural origin is HORSCH its products in seeding technology for optimal solution.
The coulter pressure controll HORSCH AutoForce allows the user to permanent, automatic adjustment of coulter `` pressure according to pre-selected parameters.
addition, HORSCH advises companies on the development of individual management concepts and process chains - and, together with its sales and service partners, ensuring seamless support, the fastest possible repairs and an immediate supply of spare parts.
This continuously compensates soil difference or varying soil conditions.
All the machines on this machine can be perfectly adapted to hard requirements (soils, climate, farm sizes...).
The generation with which seedbed preparation, sowing and fertilising can be managed in one operation.
The sowing row crops such as maize, sunflowers, soybeans and sugar beet, not only the distribution of the grains in the row but the reliable observance of the placement depth is decisive of optimum yields at the respective location.
A robust tine seeding drill has its strengths above all of mulch sowing.
Express KR combines proven HORSCH seeding technology with PTO driven by tillage air Kredo power harrow.
It enables intensive preparation under difficult conditions.
The latter is ensured of the one hand by the arrangement of the depth control wheels directly next to the seed coulter and on the other hand stabilised by sufficient coulter pressure.
The Kredo rotary cable has 10 rotors m working width.
It is designed to maximum stability in stony soils.
The sturdy frame constructions with light-weight seed coulters and large-volume seed hoppers enables high acreage output that is an optimum for cost-benefit ratio.
The HORSCH Maestro precision air seeder operates with a maximum coulter pressure 350 kg per row.
With the Sprinter, you can only bundle time-consuming processes into a single operation.
It can be equipped with quick-change tines on tow or handle.
Especially in the case of heterogeneous soil types and varying soil moisture, the quention of the correct coulter pressure often arises in practice.
At the charged time you increase the precision in seed placement and fertilisation.
Tines with hard metal coats are available for maximum service life.
Carefully you work tyre packers ensure an optimum soil contact of the seed.
Here, the proven coating technology of the cultivator tine sector is used.
The cultivator usually focuses on the most difficult soil type in the field and adjusts the coulter pressure in order to precisely maintain the desired placement depth there and to ensure that the seed is pressing into the pre-consolidated horizon as optimally as possible.
The use of the Sprinter leads not only to significant savings but also to a more uniform fielded emergence and more resistant seedlings (HORSCH PPF system).
The fine adjustment of the working depth of the power harrow is easily accessible and clearly visible from the outside.
As a result, however, the coulter pressure in the other soil zones of the field is sometimes much too high, resulting in compaction or obstacles to the development or the crop when young.
The sensor technology required for HORSCH AutoForce is located in the tandem connection of the depth guide wheels and measures the weight load on the depth guide rollers.
levelling barred can be adjusted just as easily.
The weight is recorded by means of strain gauges and is fully integrated into the hardware and software of the HORSCH Maestro.
In establishing way, you create the ideal conditions for fully exploiting and securing the expected earnings potential.
The Express KR has three packer variants.
The basic design of the Focus of MT is based on proven concept of the HORSCH Tiger MT.
The control systme itself permanently intervenes in the standard hydraulic coulter pressure system HORSCH Maestro.
HORSCH AutoForce has been available as additional equipment since 2016 and is characterized by easy integration into the existing HORSCH Maestro single grain technology.
The tool sequence starts with a 2-row heavy disc harrow for maximum chopping of crop but residues intensive mixing, followed by two rows of tines for intensive loosening and precise fertiliser placement.
The tooth packer roller with a large 64 cm diameter is suitable for all conditions.
It is the only system on the market that can guarantee the coulter pressure by hydraulic powering transmission from the centre of the machine (seed wagon) to the outer wings over the entire work width as standard.
It has a high load capacity even on the front soils, which is a positive effect on tractive effort and diesel consumption.
This makes automatics pressure control so useful.
ContourFarming this automatic adjustment of the metering frequency corner over the entire machine working width.
Before the RingFlex in tyre packer, the disc level effectively levels this surface.
For crops such as maize, sunflowers or sugar beet, an optimum sowing rate target stand just density is specified by the breeder, depending on the variety location, and is usually based on trials.
The Focus MT can be used after all crops and crop residues.
The trapezoidal ring packer has a diameter of 50 cm for heavy soils in point reconsolidation performance or 60 cm for varying soils from light to heavy with high load capacity requirements.
Each variety has a certain tolerance range, e.g. from 60 000 to 75 000 plants per hectare.
It forme perfect seed furrow even under heavy and cohesive conditions.
The seed rate should also be within this range of the headland or when cornering or turning.
The frame height of 85 cm guarantees maximum passage to blockage-free working.
The FarmFlex packer is particularly suitable for medium soils with low cohesion.
Use the cultivation of wheat for autumn tillage.
The HORSCH Maestro series with its individually electrically driven metering units offers the ideal basis for integrating an automatic adjustment of the seed rate when cornering or curving.
Perfect autumn is mixed with the following spring sowing.
The robust rubber roller diameter of 54 cm produces a stripwise reconsolidation in groove form and reduces the crusting effect expecting the soil (only available for Express 3 KR).
addition, it is possible to set up targeted fertilizer depots for corn, sunflowers and soybeans.
With a line spacing of 35 cm, all row systems 35 to 70 cm can be operated.
Placing fertiliser in the autumn has the great advantage that the sensitive soils do not have to be worked deeply in the spring, but the effect of the targeted depot fertilisation can still be fully exploited.
With the ContourFarming equipment, the Maestro 16, 24 and 36 SW are equipped with two additional radar sensors for speed detection, which are mounted on the opposite wing ends of the machine and record the speed there.
Focus TD represents the consistent further development of the "StripTill approach".
flexibility, Express KR is available with singled or double tank.
Points such as targeted loosening in later row in combination with concentrated fertiliser placement were implemented with proven components and combined with the well-known Pronto sowing technique.
With double tank version, two components can be metered into the same seed flow and placed together in the seed furrow.
A standard radar sensor is located in the middle of the machine.
The adjustment of the sowing depth is done hydraulically and is staked with the well-known coloured aluminium clips.
When the machine makes a turn, the radar sensor on the inside of the turn registers a slower speed and the radar sensor on the outside of the turn registers a higher speed.
The new generation of AirVac AirSpeed dosing units are basically very similar in design and work according to the same dosing principle.
As soon as this difference is greater than 0.6 km/h, each individual row motors of the metering units is automatically supplied with the other value corrects by the change in speed on the basis of a stored control curve.
They are universally suitable for many crops for very precise grain separation.
Express KR has a frame wheres the setting rotary harrow does not affect the sowing depth.
With different metering discs, corn, sunflowers, sugar beets, soybeans and other types of beans as well as rapeseed and sorghum can be reliably separated.
Measured terms of the time unit, the machine thus places less seed in the rows of the inside of the curve and more seed on the outside of the curve, which means that the sowing rate per hectare remains constant.
The TurboDisc coulters can be completely lifted hydraulically in order to be able to work solo with the powering harrow.
This process runs automatically and allows the yield of the respective plants to optimally exploited.
The AirVac system is based on the principle of vacuum singulation, in which the seed is sucked on a perforated disc.
In addition, seeding unit can easily be detached from the power harrow via only 4 attachment points in order to use the Kredo individually.
AutoSpeed is the convenient solution for achieving consistent deposit accuracy at optimum rights-of-way speed.
The AirSpeed system works according to the overpressure principle, in which grains are pressed against the perforated disc.
The Express TD combines the advantages of a manoeuvrable 3-point seed bar with the power of Pronto DC.
In both feeders, the grains pass through separator which ensures that double occupancy eliminated.
Varying soil conditions normally lead to different results from sowing quality (VC).
The compact as smooth as High-Speed Drill thus ensures a noticeable increase in productivity.
I use the AutoSpeed function, the driver has the desired deposit accuracy.
The special feature of this particular component is that it does not have to be replaced when changing the crop and that no adjustment work imagine to be carried out on it by the driver.
The contour separating stop has been optimised to ensure reliable separation of all crops.
The proven DiscSystem of the Express TD ensure perfect soil production at speeds of 10 to 20 km/h.
The transfer of the seed from the metering unit into the soil is the fundamental difference in the two new generations of metering units: After singling, the seed in the AirVac system is fed the furrow bottom by means of a really downpipe and pressed on the catcher roller as required.
Now that Maestro transmitted a varying target speed to the tractor, depending on whether the desired value is exceeded not.
Due to the intensive soil cultivation, a power shaft can be dispensed with.
In way, the UK is kept as constant as possible.
Today, those who create tramlines generally drive lane-to-lane despite the steering system, even if, skipping the second lane would lead to an improved workflow.
With the AirSpeed system, the separated grains are captured by an air stream, accelerated and shot with the air stream through `` shot tube into the ground.
Thanks to the large passage, 460 mm discs are insensitive to high levels of organic material.
They were intercepted and embedded in fixing catching roller.
Tramline errors are also frequently caused by unintentional counting of the track numbers, e.g. at obstacles inside the loft.
With both metering units, the grains pass through a grain sensor in the drop or shot tube for optimum monitoring of the sowing success.
The working depth of the DiscSystem can be adjusted hydraulically from the tractor.
The sensor's measuring technology is capable of counting grains, determining distances between grain and thus also transmitted imformation to the driver with regard to double and missing grains.
With HORSCH AutoLine, on the other hand, the position of finishing all other tramlines And automatically calculated on a satellite basis after the first tramline has been created.
Uniform field emergence is now a prerequisite for an crop.
The transmitted values of the singling accuracy are clearly displayed on the terminal of the machine and additionally up the safety of the sowing.
To achieve this goal, optimal levelling and reconsolidation from the seedbed must be carried out.
It is no longer necessary to follow the machine when sowing.
The generations of AirVac and AirSpeed feeders are electrically driven as standard and can control individually for each row.
The packer elements of the FarmFlex packer with 54 cm diameter are specially adapted to the seed coulters this purpose.
The technology allows the familiar functions of single row shutdown, SectionControl, VariableRate and tramline control.
Whenever the machine enters a lane that is to contain a tramline, the tramline flaps are automatically actuated.
For VariableRate, the metering systems are designed in such a way that the seed rate can be changed in relation to individual rows.
Seed placement and embedding are a crucial factor in sowing.
The prerequisite for using this function is the use of a HORSCH Touch Terminal.
Equally essential to success, however, is to the optimal windows for seeding.
Starting in 2020, selected product families of HORSCH Universal Drilling Technology will be available with new RowControl distribution tower.
In addition to high forward speeds of up to 20 km/h, the Pronto DC offers large seed hoppers for long ranges.
In the case of tramline control, it is possible to individually adjust the sowing rate in the rows to the left and right of the tramline.
All bearing points on the working tools of the Pronto DC are designed without service points.
With these advance features, full use of all the measures taken to increase precision during sowing.
HORSCH took this approach years ago and, in addition to reduced effort for daily maintenance, it offers a high degree of operational reliabilities even under the most difficult conditions.
The new double tank system MTS (Main Tank Supply) for the Maestro CV stores 3 000 litres of fertilisers and 800 litres of seed.
Due to the use of singling row cut-off, overlaps and faults are now a thing of up past.
Pronto SW concept promises maximum output for large farms after ploughing for mulch sowing.
The combination of the large-volume HORSCH seed wagon (12 000 l for 8 and 9 SW, 17 000 m for 12 SW) with the Pronto sowing unit results in significant advantaging in terms of stability, accessibility and flexibility.
Seeds, fertilizer micro-granules saved.
This facilitates the calibration process, the adjustment of the machine as well as of all low maintenance work.
Unseeded strips can precisely be sown without having to accept overlaps or so high a cropping density.
Tramlines can be switched on a single row base in any gauge and track width.
The seed is continuously transported to the individual row unit with a aid like MTS technology, it is separated by the AirVac metering unit.
Thanks for giving TurboDisc sowing coulter, speeds between 10 and 20 km/h are also possible here.
The great advantage of MTS is the simple filling of the central seed hopper with simultaneous separation of seed on the row by a short distance to the seeds of furrow.
Insertion at the beginning of the field according to the specific pattern is no longer necessary.
In both versions of the fertiliser hopper is equipped with the proven HORSCH metering technology and reliably and precisely operate the Maestro's under-foot fertiliser system.
Chassis and frame of sowing the unit form even a solid unit.
The HORSCH RowControl distribution tower is able to shut off individual rows without affecting the lateral distribution of the machine due to its sophisticated seed and air guidance.
In practice, however, depends on the application, it will make sense to combine individual rows into small sections.
The Maestro coulter last hitch can be fitted 8 rows and 9 rows with 70 optical 70 to / 80 cm and 30" row spacing.
One of the is basically comparable to the Pronto 7 to 9 DC withour seed tank.
With the development of the RowControl distribution of tower, HORSCH continues to consistently join the path of strengthen precision in seeding.
DiscSystem and the TurboDisc seed bar are lifted hydraulic cylinders.
The rigid drawbar of the seed unit is carried by the seed wagon and follows the seed wagon like a 1-axle trailer.
The application with 12 rows, distances 45 and 50 cm are available.
The newly developed clamping profile allows conversion from 12 to 8 rows.
Despite the large width of 12 m, transporting the width of 3 m is possible.
After the good experiences in the field of crop protection, the intuitive operating logic of the HORSCH Leeb LT has been optimized out for the field of seeding technology.
With the I-Manager, HORSCH is gradually introducing a new ISOBUS operating concept to touch terminals.
This self-developed system has many new and innovative functions that make it easier for the farmer to operate and monitor his technology.
The new row body has a wide, stable parallelogram and is equipped with a standard with a hydraulic cylinder for coulter pressure generation.
example, in the future he can configure the display of the terminal interface according to his wishes.
Due to the seed wagon concept, the filling leveling of the seed hopper has no influence on the working depth of the way of sowing unit.
With I-Manager hardware and software, a platform has been specifically created to handle an almost unlimited number of sections and components in the dosing process.
Coulter morning pressure of up to 350 kg per row can be used manually in the terminal or fully automatically with innovative AutoForce coulter pressure control system.
The HORSCH seed wagon provides large tank volumes to worker widths from 8 to m.
The aim of this development is to introduce a fully diagnosable system to all areas of seeding technology in future.
The weight of the seed wagon is used to generate coulter pressure across the full width of the machine, relieving load on the seed wagon wheels when sowing.
Even without the filling auger, the filling openings of the seed wagon are very easy to reach, as the wings of the Pronto sowing unit do not interfere with the filling process.
Thanks for the double tank system, fertiliser be transported at the same time and incorporated directly into the soil via the PPF system (NOT with Pronto 12 SW 3 m transport width).
In future, HorschConnect will serve as a network of the customer, the machine and the HORSCH.
AirVac dosing units can be used universally for exact grain separation.
This connectivity is possibles by the SmartCan module, which will allow more and more HORSCH machines to be equipped with job computers in the future.
With different metering discs, corn, sugar beets, soybeans and rapeseed can reliably separated.
The AirVac system is based on the principle of vacuum singulation, which the seed is sucked on a perforated disc.
Data are available on the cloud or usable via WLAN for mobile device (e.g. smartphone or tablet).
A doubling drop gate below the dosing unit allows a mechanical or optionally electronic half-side switching.
The grains picked up a scraper in dosing process, which ensures double occupancies eliminated.
He avoids overlaps and saves seed fertiliser.
A GPS receiver completes the various possibilities.
The filling screw optionally available.
This is where HORSCH first come in play.
The special feature of the AirVac scraper is that the user does not have any adjustments.
With the help of this app, which is available for Android and iOS, the customer can access the recorded data directly with his smartphone.
The Pronto 6 AS allows the use of the seed wagon with pre-implements in combination TurboDisc tyre packer combination or the Maestro RV.
The contouring of the scraper has been optimised to ensure reliable separation of all crops.
The seed is fed from the AirVac metering unit of the furrow bottom means a downpipe.
MobileControl also enables the farmer to carry out machine functions such as calibration of HORSCH seed drills, nozzle tests on Leeb crop protection sprayer or a single row tests on Maestro precision air seeders very easily with his mobile phone.
If the TurboDisc coulter is used for drilling, high working speeds of up to 20 km/h and being associated with high acreage outputs are possible.
A grain sensor is integrated into the downpipe for optimum monitoring of the sowing success.
The proven Pronto principle of seedbed preparation, reconsolidation sowing ensures the highest precision seed placements and safe and high field emergence.
Wireless software updates or remote diagnostics cases of error messages are also planned for future HorschConnect.
Furthermore, datums exchange various farm management systems will be possible.
For sowing row crops (e.g. maize and in beet) the Pronto 6 AS You can be combined with a Maestro RV.
The sensor's measurement technology is able to count grains, determine distances between grains and thus provided the driver with information regarding double missing grains.
The system will already be connected to the agrirouter for the Agritechnica 2019.
The singling of the Maestro ensures that the crop is sown using the single grain method and the seed wagon of the Pronto 6 AS to be used for fertiliser.
Additional benefits are provided by the front-mounted disc harrow for seedbed preparation and levelling of the tractor tracks.
DKE GmbH is a consortium of various companies in the agricultural industry, in which HORSCH also participates.
The transmitted values of singling accuracy are clearly displayed in terminal of a machine and additionally increase the safety during sowing.
The aim of this alliance is to develop an interface for data in order to transmit digital information wirelessly to participating partners.
The AirVac separating stop is electrically driven as standard and can be controlled individually for each row.
This technology allows the familiars functions of single row shutdown, SectionControl, tramline control.
The change between the TurboDisc coulter attachment and the Maestro RV can be made very easily and quickly via an integrated 3-point interface of the Pronto 6 AS.
For VariableRate, the watch AirVac sistem is designed so that the seed rate can be changed on a row-by-row basis.
The agrirouter functions of people as data hub and HORSCH work on a machine-side interface in this.
Pronto 6 AS can be equipped with a large single tank (3 500 l) for long ranges.
In the course of tramline control, it is possible to individually adjust the sowing rate in the rows to the left and right of the tramline.
A double tank (5 000 l) is available as an option for storing seed and fertiliser.
With these advanced functions, measures increase precision during sowing will be fully exploited.
The fertiliser can be placed together with the seed (G and F) as a separate under-foot fertiliser (PPF) next to the row.
In a future, this will make it possible for example, to easily transfer application cards or order from the PC in the office to the machine or back again.
The compact unit Maestro DV consisting of a large volume seed wagon, a seed bar with 6 m working width as a precision seed bar with 8 row offers high performance with comparatively low demands on the towing vehicle.
The agrirouter did not store any data, but merely look forward to it.
The chassis of the Pronto 6 AS is equipped in a separate axle.
All turning operations and road transports are carried out on large-volume wheels (800 45 26.5).
By mountings One seed bar via a 4-point linkage, it is possible to mount a Pronto NT seed bar with 4 or 5 m width for broad sowing methods.
In the working position, the wheels are completely lifted out in conjunctions with the TurboDisc tyre packer combination so that the targeted reconsolidation with the tyre at packer can take place.
This allows the Maestro DV to be used even more universally and happy it all-rounder among seed drills.
In order to optimally see all customer requirements, the Maestro DV seed wagon can be supplied in two configurations.
When working with the president Maestro RV, the traffic wheels reliably carry the weight of the seed wagon.
When working with the Maestro DV with a Pronto NT seed bar, seed and fertiliser can be applied simultaneously in the 3 500 litre double tank as a Grain & Fertiliser system in the seed slot.
